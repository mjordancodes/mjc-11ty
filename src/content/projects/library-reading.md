This project is mostly a playground for different tools and technologies I've been wanting to try. There very likely will be over-engineering as I am using a lot of tools for the sake of learning them, not because the project _needs_ them.

Some of the included tech (so far):

- React (create-react-app)
- Sass (scss)
- CSS Modules
- Airtable (+ airtable.js npm package)

To be included:

- Storybook
- Testing?
- D3?
