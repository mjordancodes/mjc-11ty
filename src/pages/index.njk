  Hello! and welcome to my new, in-progress, corner of the internet! My name is Jordan and I like to build things. 
</p>

<p>
  This site is another adventure into the JAMstack. Currently it is using 11ty + nunjucks and static data files. I do plan on hooking up a headless CMS... just as soon as I pick one...
</p>


<h2>About Me</h2>
{# {% include "components/about/summary-picker.njk" %} #}
{{ me.summary.first.medium | safe }}

<h2>Featured Content:</h2>
<p>Some of my favorite experiments, projects, and talks. </p>
{% import "components/mixed-content-list.njk" as contentList %}
{{ contentList.list(collections.featured, "") }}
