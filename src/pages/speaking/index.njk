<p>I've spoken at several local meetups on technical and non-technical topics both in-person and online. During 2018, I spoke at my first conference, and in 2019 gave a keynote at Indie Web Summit. I love speaking and presenting as it gives me an opportunity to share all my favorite things I have learnt with others in my community.</p>

<p>Currently I am working on updating my older talks and writing new ones. Check back soon for new talks!</p>
