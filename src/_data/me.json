I also volunteer as a Director with my local Women Who Code chapter here in Boulder/Denver. My background in teaching, code, and art gives me a unique perspective and ability to solve and explain complex problems in a clear way. I love everything to do with CSS and rubber duck debugging.</p> <p>Constantly fueled by my curiosity and passion for knowledge, I like to stay current on going-ons in the web world by attending meetups/conferences, reading, and pursuing continued coursework whenever I can. I believe that teaching something is one of the best ways to ensure mastery, so I jump on any opportunity to do so, including speaking at events and pairing with other developers at work.</p> <p>Outside of work I like to nerd out on SVG Animations, Animal Crossing (or whatever game I am currently playing), and whatever book I am currently reading. I am a hobby photographer and dabble in various forms of arts and crafts when I have time. I love creating things whether it is in code or in art.</p>",
